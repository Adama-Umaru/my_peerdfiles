# we first create a new PDF document using the canvas.Canvas method. We then set the background color of the header and body using the setFillColor method and draw rectangles using the rect method to fill the header and body with the respective colors. We then add text to the header and body using the setFont and drawString methods. Finally, we save the PDF document using the save method.

# Note code uses the reportlab library to set the background color of the PDF document. You can install this library using pip install reportlab. If you prefer to use another library or method to set the background color, you can modify the code accordingly.
